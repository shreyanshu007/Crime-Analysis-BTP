## Heat Map Details 

There is a file named geo_json_generator.py -> It will read the LocationInfo table from database and will generate a gerjson file.
This file has every geocordinate along with its crime score.

For gerenating the heatmap I have used a tool called mapbox.
Link -> https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/heatmap-layer/

This will take the geojson file as data input.
